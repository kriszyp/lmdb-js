.SH NAME
ldap - OpenLDAP Lightweight Directory Access Protocol API
.SH LIBRARY
OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <ldap.h>
.ft
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol provides access to X.500
directory services.  The services may be stand\-alone or part of
a distributed directory service.  This API supports LDAP over TCP
(RFC2251), LDAP over SSL, and LDAP over IPC (UNIX domain sockets).
This API supports SASL (RFC2829) and Start TLS (RFC2830).  This
API is based upon IETF C LDAP API draft specification, a work in
progress.
.LP
The OpenLDAP Software package includes a stand\-alone server in
.BR slapd (8),
various LDAP clients, and an LDAP client library used to provide
programmatic access to the LDAP protocol. This man page gives an
overview of the LDAP library routines.
.LP
Both synchronous and asynchronous APIs are provided.  Also included are
various routines to parse the results returned from these routines.
These routines are found in the \-lldap library.
.LP
The basic interaction is as follows.  A session handle is
created using
.BR ldap_init (3)
or
.BR ldap_initialize (3).
(The
.BR ldap_initialize (3)
routine is preferred, but is not part of the draft specification.)
The underlying session is established upon first use which is
commonly an LDAP bind operation.  The LDAP bind operation is
performed by calling
.BR ldap_sasl_bind (3)
or one of its friends.  Next, other operations are performed
by calling one of the synchronous or asynchronous routines (e.g.,
.BR ldap_search_ext_s (3)
or
.BR ldap_search_ext (3)
followed by
.BR ldap_result (3)).
Results returned from these routines are interpreted by calling the
LDAP parsing routines such as
.BR ldap_parse_result (3).
The LDAP association and underlying connection is terminated by calling
.BR ldap_unbind_ext (3).
Errors can be interpreted by calling
.BR ldap_err2string (3).
.SH SEARCH FILTERS
Search filters to be passed to the ldap search routines are to be
constructed by hand and should conform to RFC 2254.
.SH DISPLAYING RESULTS
Results obtained from the ldap search routines can be output by hand,
by calling
.BR ldap_first_entry (3)
and
.BR ldap_next_entry (3)
to step through
the entries returned,
.BR ldap_first_attribute (3)
and
.BR ldap_next_attribute (3)
to step through an entry's attributes, and
.BR ldap_get_values (3)
to retrieve a given attribute's values.  Attribute values
may or may not be displayable.
.SH CONTROLS
This library supports both LDAP Version 2 and Version 3, with the Version 2
protocol selected by default.
LDAP Version 3 operations can be extended through the use of controls. Controls
can be sent to a server or returned to the client with any LDAP message.
Extended versions of the standard routines are available for use with
controls. These routines are generally named by adding
.BR _ext
to the regular routine's name.
.SH UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATORS (URLS)
The
.BR ldap_url (3)
routines can be used to test a URL to see if it is an LDAP URL, to parse LDAP
URLs into their component pieces, and to initiate searches directly using
an LDAP URL.
.SH CACHING
The
.BR ldap_cache (3)
routines implement a local client caching scheme,
providing a substantial performance increase for repeated queries.
Caching is experiemental.
.SH UTILITY ROUTINES
Also provided are various utility routines.  The
.BR ldap_sort (3)
routines are used to sort the entries and values returned via
the ldap search routines. 
.SH BER LIBRARY
Also included in the distribution is a set of lightweight Basic
Encoding Rules routines.  These routines are used by the LDAP library
routines to encode and decode LDAP protocol elements using the
(slightly simplified) Basic Encoding Rules defined by LDAP.  They are
not normally used directly by an LDAP application program except
in the handling of controls and extended operations.  The
routines provide a printf and scanf\-like interface, as well as
lower\-level access.  These routines are discussed in
.BR lber\-decode (3),
.BR lber\-encode (3),
.BR lber\-memory (3),
and
.BR lber\-types (3).
