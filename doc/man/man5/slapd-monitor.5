.SH NAME
slapd-monitor \- Monitor backend to slapd
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The monitor backend to
.BR slapd (8)
is not an actual database; if enabled, it is automatically generated
and dynamically maintained by slapd with information about the running 
status of the daemon.

.SH CONFIGURATION
These
.B slapd.conf
options apply to the monitor backend database.
That is, they must follow a "database monitor" line and come before any
subsequent "backend" or "database" lines.
As opposed to most databases, the monitor database can be instantiated
only once, i.e. only one occurrence of "database monitor" can occur
in the 
.BR slapd.conf (5)
file.
Moreover, the suffix of the database cannot be explicitly set by means
of the 
.B suffix
directive; on the contrary, the suffix is automatically set
to "\fIcn=Monitor\fP".
.LP
The
.B monitor
database honors the 
.B rootdn
and the
.B rootpw
directives, and the usual ACL directives, e.g. the
.B access
directive.
.LP
The following directives can be used:
.TP
.B l <locality>
The
.B <locality>
string is added to the "\fIcn=Monitor\fP" entry as value of the
.B l
attribute (Note: this may be subjected to changes).
.LP
Other database options are described in the
.BR slapd.conf (5)
manual page.
.SH USAGE
The usage is:
.TP
1) enable the monitor backend at configure:
.LP
.RS
.nf
configure --enable-monitor
.fi
.RE
.TP
2) activate the monitor database in the
.BR slapd.conf (5)
file:
.LP
.RS
.nf
database monitor
.fi
.RE
.TP
3) add ACLs as detailed in
.BR slapd.access (5)
to control access to the database, e.g.:
.LP
.RS
.nf
access to dn.subtree="cn=Monitor"
	by dn.exact="uid=Admin,dc=my,dc=org" write
	by users read
	by * none
.fi
.RE
.TP
4) ensure that the \fBcore.schema\fP file is loaded.
The monitor backend relies on some standard track attributeTypes
that must be already defined when the backend is started.
.SH KNOWN LIMITATIONS
The monitor backend does not honor size/time limits in search operations.
