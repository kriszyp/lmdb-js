.SH NAME
slapo-valsort \- Value Sorting overlay
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Value Sorting overlay can be used with a backend database to sort the
values of specific multi-valued attributes within a subtree. The sorting
occurs whenever the attributes are returned in a search response.
.LP
Sorting can be specified in ascending or descending order, using either
numeric or alphanumeric sort methods. Additionally, a "weighted" sort can
be specified, which uses a numeric weight prepended to the attribute values.
The weighted sort is always performed in ascending order, but may be combined
with the other methods for values that all have equal weights. The weight
is specified by prepending an integer weight
.B {<weight>}
in front of each value of the attribute for which weighted sorting is
desired. This weighting factor is stripped off and never returned in
search results.

.SH CONFIGURATION
These
.B slapd.conf
options apply to the Value Sorting overlay.
They should appear after the
.B overlay
directive and before any subsequent
.B database
directive.
.TP
.B valsort-attr <attribute> <baseDN> (<sort-method> | weighted [<sort-method>])
Configure a sorting method for the specified
.B attribute
in the subtree rooted at
.BR baseDN .
The 
.B sort-method
may be one of
.BR alpha-ascend ,
.BR alpha-descend ,
.BR numeric-ascend ,
or
.BR numeric-descend .
If the special
.B weighted
method is specified, a secondary sort-method may also be specified. It is an
error to specify an alphanumeric sort-method for an attribute with Integer
or NumericString syntax, and it is an error to specify a numeric sort for
an attribute with a syntax other than Integer or NumericString.
.SH EXAMPLES

.nf
	database bdb
	suffix dc=example,dc=com
	...
	overlay valsort
	valsort-attr member ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com alpha-ascend
