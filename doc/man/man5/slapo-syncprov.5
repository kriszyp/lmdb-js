.SH NAME
slapo-syncprov \- Syncrepl Provider overlay
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Syncrepl Provider overlay implements the provider-side support for
syncrepl replication, including persistent search functionality. The overlay
can be used with any backend that maintains entryCSN and entryUUID
attributes for its entries. It also creates a contextCSN attribute in
the root entry of the database.

The contextCSN is updated for every write operation performed against the
database. To reduce database contention, the contextCSN is only updated in
memory. The value is written to the database on server shutdown and read into
memory on startup, and maintained in memory thereafter. Checkpoints may be
configured to write the contextCSN into the underlying database to minimize
recovery time after an unclean shutdown.

Note that due to deadlock constraints in the LDBM database, this overlay
will only work in RefreshOnly mode, and cannot perform checkpoints, on LDBM.

On databases that support inequality indexing, it is helpful to set an
eq index on the entryCSN attribute when using this overlay.
.SH CONFIGURATION
These
.B slapd.conf
options apply to the Syncrepl Provider overlay.
They should appear after the
.B overlay
directive and before any subsequent
.B database
directive.
.TP
.B syncprov-checkpoint <ops> <minutes>
After a write operation has succeeded, write the contextCSN to the underlying
database if
.B <ops>
write operations or more than
.B <minutes>
time have passed
since the last checkpoint. Checkpointing is disabled by default.
.TP
.B syncprov-sessionlog <size>
Specify a session log for recording information about write operations made
on the database.  The
.B <size>
specifies the number of operations that are recorded in the log. All write
operations (except Adds) are recorded in the log.
When using the session log, it is helpful to set an eq index on the
entryUUID attribute in the underlying database.
