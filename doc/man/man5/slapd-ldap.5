.SH NAME
slapd-ldap \- LDAP backend to slapd
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The LDAP backend to
.BR slapd (8)
is not an actual database; instead it acts as a proxy to forward incoming
requests to another LDAP server. While processing requests it will also
chase referrals, so that referrals are fully processed instead of being
returned to the slapd client.

Sessions that explicitly Bind to the back-ldap database always create their
own private connection to the remote LDAP server. Anonymous sessions will
share a single anonymous connection to the remote server. For sessions bound
through other mechanisms, all sessions with the same DN will share the
same connection. This connection pooling strategy can enhance the proxy's
efficiency by reducing the overhead of repeatedly making/breaking multiple
connections.

The ldap database can also act as an information service, i.e. the identity
of locally authenticated clients is asserted to the remote server, possibly
in some modified form.
For this purpose, the proxy binds to the remote server with some 
administrative identity, and, if required, authorizes the asserted identity.
See the 
.IR idassert- *
rules below.
The administrative identity of the proxy, on the remote server, must be 
allowed to authorize by means of appropriate
.B authzTo
rules; see 
.BR slapd.conf (5)
for details.

.SH CONFIGURATION
These
.B slapd.conf
options apply to the LDAP backend database.
That is, they must follow a "database ldap" line and come before any
subsequent "backend" or "database" lines.
Other database options are described in the
.BR slapd.conf (5)
manual page.
.LP
Note: It is strongly recommended to set
.LP
.RS
.nf
lastmod  off
.fi
.RE
.LP
for every
.B ldap
and
.B meta
database.
This is because operational attributes related to entry creation and
modification should not be used, as they could be passed to the target
servers, generating an error.
.TP
.B uri <ldapurl>
LDAP server to use.  Multiple URIs can be set in in a single
.B ldapurl
argument, resulting in the underlying library automatically 
call the first server of the list that responds, e.g. 

\fBuri "ldap://host/ ldap://backup-host"\fP

The URI list is space- or comma-separated.
.TP
.B server <hostport>
Obsolete option; same as `uri ldap://<hostport>/'.
.TP
.B acl-authcDN "<administrative DN for access control purposes>"
DN which is used to query the target server for acl checking; it
should have read access on the target server to attributes used on the
proxy for acl checking.
There is no risk of giving away such values; they are only used to
check permissions.
.B The acl-authcDN identity is by no means implicitly used by the proxy 
.B when the client connects anonymously.
.TP
.B acl-passwd <password>
Password used with the bind DN above.
.TP
.B idassert-authcdn "<administrative DN for proxyAuthz purposes>"
DN which is used to propagate the client's identity to the target
by means of the proxyAuthz control when the client does not
belong to the DIT fragment that is being proxyied by back-ldap.
This is useful when operations performed by users bound to another 
backend are propagated through back-ldap.
This requires the entry with 
.B idassert-authcdn
identity on the remote server to have
.B proxyAuthz
privileges on a wide set of DNs, e.g.
.BR authzTo=dn.subtree:"" ,
and the remote server to have
.B authz-policy
set to 
.B to
or 
.BR both .
See 
.BR slapd.conf (5)
for details on these statements and for remarks and drawbacks about
their usage.
.TP
.B idassert-passwd <password>
Password used with the proxy authzDN above.
.TP
.B idassert-mode <mode>
defines what type of
.I identity assertion
is used.
The supported modes are:
.RS
.RS
.TP
.B <mode>={legacy|anonymous|none|<id>|self}
.RE
.RS
.B <id>={u:<ID>|[dn:]<DN>}
.RE

The default is 
.BR legacy ,
which implies that the proxy will bind as
.I idassert-authcdn
and assert the client's identity when it is not anonymous.
Direct binds are always proxied.
The other modes imply that the proxy will always bind as 
.IR idassert-authcdn ,
unless restricted by
.BR idassert-authzFrom
rules (see below), in which case the operation will fail;
eventually, it will assert some other identity according to
.BR <mode> .
Other identity assertion modes are
.BR anonymous
and
.BR self ,
which respectively mean that the 
.I empty 
or the 
.IR client 's 
identity
will be asserted;
.BR none ,
which means that no proxyAuthz control will be used, so the
.I idassert-authcdn
identity will be asserted.
Moreover, if a string prefixed with
.B u:
or 
.B dn:
is used as 
.BR <mode> ,
that identity will be asserted.
Ths string is also treated as a DN if it is not prefixed
by any recognized type indicator.  Whether or not the 
.B dn: 
prefix is present, the string must pass DN validation and normalization.
For all modes that require the use of the
.I proxyAuthz 
control, on the remote server the proxy identity must have appropriate 
.I authzTo
permissions, or the asserted identities must have appropriate
.I authzFrom 
permissions.  Note, however, that the ID assertion feature is mostly 
useful when the asserted identities do not exist on the remote server.
.RE
.TP
.B idassert-authzFrom <authz>
if defined, selects what
.I local
identities are authorized to exploit the identity assertion feature.
The string
.B authz 
follows the rules defined for the
.I authzFrom
attribute.
See 
.BR slapd.conf (5),
section related to
.BR authz-policy ,
for details on the supported syntaxes.
.TP
.B idassert-method <method> [<saslargs>]
where valid method values are
.RS
.TP
.B <method>={none|simple|sasl}
.RE
.RS
.B <saslargs>=[mech=<mech>] [realm=<realm>] [authcid=<authcid>] [cred=<cred>]

.RE
.RS
If method is 
.IR sasl ,
extra parameters can be given a described above.
The default is
.BR simple ;
.B none
inhibits proxy authorization;
.B sasl
uses a SASL bind with the above parameters; if required,
.I authorization
is performed by means of native SASL mechanism, and no proxyAuthz
is used for subsequent operations.
.RE
.TP
.B proxy-whoami
Turns on proxying of the WhoAmI extended operation. If this option is
given, back-ldap will replace slapd's original WhoAmI routine with its
own. On slapd sessions that were authenticated by back-ldap, the WhoAmI
request will be forwarded to the remote LDAP server. Other sessions will
be handled by the local slapd, as before. This option is mainly useful
in conjunction with Proxy Authorization.
.TP
.B rebind-as-user
If this option is given, the client's bind credentials are remembered
for rebinds when chasing referrals.
.TP
.B suffixmassage <suffix> <massaged (remote) suffix>
DNs ending with <suffix> in a request are changed to end with <remote
suffix> before sending the request to the remote server, and <remote
suffix> in the results are changed back to <suffix> before returning
them to the client.
The <suffix> field must be defined as a valid suffix
for the current database.
.TP
.B map "{attribute | objectclass} [<local name> | *] {<foreign name> | *}"
Map attribute names and object classes from the foreign server to
different values on the local slapd.
The reason is that some attributes might not be part of the local
slapd's schema, some attribute names might be different but serve the
same purpose, etc.
If local or foreign name is `*', the name is preserved.
If local name is omitted, the foreign name is removed.
Unmapped names are preseved if both local and foreign name are `*',
and removed if local name is omitted and foreign name is `*'.
.TP
.B rewrite*
The rewrite options are described in the "REWRITING" section of the
.BR slapd-meta (5)
manual page.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following directives map the object class `groupOfNames' to
the object class `groupOfUniqueNames' and the attribute type
`member' to the attribute type `uniqueMember':
.LP
.RS
.nf
map objectclass groupOfNames groupOfUniqueNames
map attribute uniqueMember member
.fi
.RE
.LP
This presents a limited attribute set from the foreign
server:
.LP
.RS
.nf
map attribute cn *
map attribute sn *
map attribute manager *
map attribute description *
map attribute *
.fi
.RE
.LP
These lines map cn, sn, manager, and description to themselves, and 
any other attribute gets "removed" from the object before it is sent 
to the client (or sent up to the LDAP server).  This is obviously a 
simplistic example, but you get the point.
