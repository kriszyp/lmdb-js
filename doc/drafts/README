Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that other groups
may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material
or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

OpenLDAP maintains copies of drafts for which we have and/or
are planning "experimental" implementations of.  The I-D
found in this directory may be stale, expired, or otherwise
out of date.

Please refer to http://www.ietf.org/ for latest revisions (and
