INTERNET-DRAFT                LDAP entryDN              14 February 2007


Abstract

  This document describes the LDAP/X.500 'entryDN' operational
  attribute.  The attribute provides a copy of the entry's distinguished
  name for use in attribute value assertions.


1. Background and Intended Use

  In X.500 Directory Services [X.501], such as those accessible using
  the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [RFC4510], an entry
  is identified by its distinguished name (DN) [RFC4512].  However, as
  an entry's DN is not an attribute of the entry, it is not possible to
  perform attribute value assertions [RFC4511] against it.

  This document describes the 'entryDN' operational attribute which
  holds a copy of the entry's distributed name.  This attribute may be
  used in search filters.  For instance, searching the subtree
  <dc=example,dc=com> with the filter:
      (entryDN:componentFilterMatch:=or:{
          item:{ component "3", rule rdnMatch, value "ou=A" },
          item:{ component "3", rule rdnMatch, value "ou=B" } })
  would return entries in the subtree <ou=A,dc=example,dc=com> and
  entries in subtree <ou=B,dc=example,com>, but would not return any
  other entries in the subtree <dc=example,dc=com>.

  In this document, DNs are presented using the string representation
  defined in [RFC4514].  Search filters above is described using the
  string representation defined in [RFC4515] with whitespace (line
  breaks and indentation) added to improve readability.  The
  'componetFilterMatch' and 'rdnMatch' rules are specified in [RFC3687].

  Schema definitions are provided using LDAP description formats
  [RFC4512].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for
  readability.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


2. 'entryDN' Operational Attribute

  The 'entryDN' operational attribute provides a copy of the entry's
  current DN.

  The following is a LDAP attribute type description suitable for
  publication in subschema subentries.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID NAME 'entryDN'
          DESC 'DN of the entry'
          EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
          SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12

          USAGE directoryOperation )

  Note that the DN of the entry cannot be modified through this
  attribute.


3. Security Considerations

  As this attribute only provides an additional mechanism to access an
  entry's DN, the introduction of this attribute is not believed to
  introduce new security considerations.


4. IANA Considerations

4.1. Object Identifier Registration

  It is requested that IANA register upon Standards Action assign an
  LDAP Object Identifier [RFC4520] for use in this document.

      Subject: Request for LDAP OID Registration
      Person & email address to contact for further information:

      Specification: RFC XXXX
      Author/Change Controller: IESG
      Comments:
          Identifies the 'entryDN' attribute type


5.4. 'entryDN' Descriptor Registration

  It is requested that IANA register upon Standards Action the LDAP
  'entryDN' descriptor [RFC4520].

      Subject: Request for LDAP Descriptor Registration
      Descriptor (short name): entryDN
      Object Identifier: IANA-ASSIGNED-OID
      Person & email address to contact for further information:
