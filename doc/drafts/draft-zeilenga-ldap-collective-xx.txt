Abstract

  X.500 collective attributes allow common characteristics to be shared
  between collections of entries.  This document summarizes the X.500
  information model for collective attributes and describes use of
  collective attributes in LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).
  This document provides schema definitions for collective attributes
  for use in LDAP.

INTERNET-DRAFT         LDAP Collective Attributes            17 May 2002


Conventions

  Schema definitions are provided using LDAPv3 description formats
  [RFC2252].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for
  readability.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


1. Introduction

  In X.500, a collective attribute is "a user attribute whose values are
  the same for each member of an entry collection" [X.501].  This
  document details their use in the Lightweight Directory Access
  Protocol (LDAP) [LDAPTS].


1.1. Entry Collections

  A collection of entries is a grouping of object and alias entries
  based upon common properties or shared relationship between the
  corresponding entries which share certain attributes.  An entry
  collection consists of all entries within scope of a collective
  attributes subentry [SUBENTRY].  An entry can belong to several entry
  collections.


1.2. Collective Attributes

  Attributes shared by the entries comprising an entry collection are
  called collective attributes.  Values of collective attributes are
  visible but not updateable to clients accessing entries within the
  collection.  Collective attributes are updated (i.e. modified) via
  their associated collective attributes subentry.

  When an entry belongs to multiple entry collections, the entry's
  values of each collective attribute are combined such that independent
  sources of these values are not manifested to clients.

  Entries can specifically exclude a particular collective attribute by
  listing the attribute as a value of the collectiveExclusions
  attribute.  Like other user attributes, collective attributes are
  subject to a variety of controls including access, administrative, and
  content controls.

INTERNET-DRAFT         LDAP Collective Attributes            17 May 2002


2. System Schema for Collective Attributes

  The following operational attributes are used to manage Collective
  Attributes.  LDAP servers [LDAPTS] MUST act in accordance with the
  X.500 Directory Models [X.501] when providing this service.


2.1. collectiveAttributeSubentry

  Subentries of this object class are used to administer collective
  attributes and are referred to as collective attribute subentries.

      ( 2.5.20.2 NAME 'collectiveAttributeSubentry' AUXILIARY )

  A collective attribute subentry SHOULD contain at least one collective
  attribute.  The collective attributes contained within a collective
  attribute subentry are available for finding, searching, and
  comparison at every entry within the scope of the subentry. The
  collective attributes, however, are administered (e.g. modified) via
  the subentry.

  Implementations of this specification SHOULD support collective
  attribute subentries in both collectiveAttributeSpecificArea
  (2.5.23.5) and collectiveAttributeInnerArea (2.5.23.6) administrative
  areas [SUBENTRY][X.501].


2.2. collectiveAttributeSubentries

  The collectiveAttributeSubentries operational attribute identifies all
  collective attribute subentries that affect the entry.

      ( 2.5.18.12 NAME 'collectiveAttributeSubentries'
        EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12
        USAGE directoryOperation NO-USER-MODIFICATION )


2.3. collectiveExclusions

  The collectiveExclusions operational attribute allows particular
  collective attributes to be excluded from an entry.  It MAY appear in
  any entry and MAY have multiple values.

      ( 2.5.18.7 NAME 'collectiveExclusions'
        EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch
        SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38
        USAGE directoryOperation )

INTERNET-DRAFT         LDAP Collective Attributes            17 May 2002


  The descriptor excludeAllCollectiveAttributes is associated with the
  OID 2.5.18.0.  When this descriptor or OID is present as a value of
  the collectiveExclusions attribute, all collective attributes are
  excluded from an entry.


3. Collective Attribute Types

  A userApplications attribute type can be defined to be COLLECTIVE
  [RFC2252].  This indicates that the same attribute values will appear
  in the entries of an entry collection subject to the use of the
  collectiveExclusions attribute and other administrative controls.
  These administrative controls MAY include DIT Content Rules, if
  implemented.

  Collective attribute types are commonly defined as subtypes of non-
  collective attribute types.  By convention, collective attributes are
  named by prefixing the name of their non-collective supertype with
  "c-".  For example, the collective telephone attribute is named
  c-TelephoneNumber after its non-collective supertype telephoneNumber.

  Non-collective attributes types SHALL NOT subtype collective
  attributes.

  Collective attributes SHALL NOT be SINGLE-VALUED.  Collective
  attribute types SHALL NOT appear in the attribute types of an object
  class definition.

  Operational attributes SHALL NOT be defined to be collective.

  The remainder of section provides a summary of collective attributes
  derived from those defined in [X.520].  The SUPerior attribute types
  are described in [RFC 2256] for use with LDAP.

  Implementations of this specification SHOULD support the following
  collective attributes and MAY support additional collective
  attributes.


3.1. Collective Locality Name

  The c-l attribute type specifies a locality name for a collection of
  entries.

      ( 2.5.4.7.1 NAME 'c-l'
        SUP l COLLECTIVE )

  collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.8.1 NAME 'c-st'

  The c-ou attribute type specifies an organizational unit name for a
  collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.11.1 NAME 'c-ou'
        SUP ou COLLECTIVE )


3.6. Collective Postal Address

  collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.16.1 NAME 'c-PostalAddress'
        SUP postalAddress COLLECTIVE )


3.7. Collective Postal Code

  The c-PostalCode attribute type specifies a postal code for a

  collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.17.1 NAME 'c-PostalCode'
        SUP postalCode COLLECTIVE )


3.8. Collective Post Office Box

  The c-PostOfficeBox attribute type specifies a post office box for a
  collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.18.1 NAME 'c-PostOfficeBox'
        SUP postOfficeBox COLLECTIVE )


3.9. Collective Physical Delivery Office Name

  The c-PhysicalDeliveryOfficeName attribute type specifies a physical
  delivery office name for a collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.19.1 NAME 'c-PhysicalDeliveryOfficeName'
        SUP physicalDeliveryOfficeName COLLECTIVE )


3.10. Collective Telephone Number

  collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.21.1 NAME 'c-TelexNumber'
        SUP telexNumber COLLECTIVE )


3.13. Collective Facsimile Telephone Number

  The c-FacsimileTelephoneNumber attribute type specifies a facsimile
  telephone number for a collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.23.1 NAME 'c-FacsimileTelephoneNumber'

  international ISDN number for a collection of entries.

      ( 2.5.4.25.1 NAME 'c-InternationalISDNNumber'
        SUP internationalISDNNumber COLLECTIVE )

  security considerations to LDAP [LDAPTS].
