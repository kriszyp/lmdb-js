#  Gateway-switching is an original feature of the TWEB, www-x500-gateway.
#  Switching enables TWEB to generate hyper-links, that are directed towards
#  other well-known gateways. Following those hyper-links will lead the
#  user to those gateways, effectively balancing the load between a net
#  of gateways. Another benefit is the 'Corporate Identity' each gateway
#  can implement for an organizations own directory data.
#
#  Gateway-switching can be configured statically, in the config files
#  tweb.rc and/or tweb.conf.? , or dynamically, via hints in the 
#  directory data to be display'ed.
#
#  Select dynamic gateway-switching: TWEB will look for labeleduri
#  attributes within each entry to be display'ed as a hyper-link
#  before constructing the host-part of the hyper-link URL; the
#  labelleduri attribut must follow the syntax:
#      <base-url-of-the-other-gateway> <some-label> (gw[-<language-key>])
#  The DN of the entry will be appended to the base-url, if the language
#  selection matches, or no specific selection is given (gw)
#
DYNAMIC-GW

#  Configure static gateway switches; they may be replaced at run-time by
#  dynamic switches (in tweb.rc, gateways, which only support one language
#  are given; gatways supporting more languages are defined in the
#  tweb.conf.? files)
