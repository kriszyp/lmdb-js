REQUIRED SOFTWARE
	Build OpenLDAP requires the following software components:

	Base system (libraries and tools):
		Standard C compiler, headers, and libraries
		POSIX REGEX headers and libraries

	SLAPD:
		LDBM compatible datastore
			(Berkeley DB, Sleepycat DB2, or GDBM)

	SLURPD:
		LTHREAD compatible thread package
			(POSIX pthreads, MIT pthreads, Mach Cthreads or Sun LWP)

	LDAPD:
		ISODE compatible X.500 distribution

	CLIENTS/CONTRIB ware:
		Depends on package.  See per package README.
		

MAKING AND INSTALLING THE DISTRIBUTION
	This is a quick guide.  For details, see the INSTALL file.

	% ./configure
		autoconf OpenLDAP for current platform

	% ./configure --help
		This will list the available options.
		The configure script will also use your environmental
		variables for determining compiler/linker options.
		These environment variables are used:
			CC			C compiler	(cc, ecgs)
			CFLAGS		C Flags		(-ansi)
			CPPFLAGS	CPP Flags	(-I -D)
			LDFLAGS		LDFLAGS		(-L -l)

	% [env settings] ./configure [options]
		this will configure the build system

	% make depend
		this will create dependency information

	% make 
		this will build the system

	% su
	# make install

    in this directory.  This should produce something that basically
    works.  You can "cd tests; make" to verify the build.

    You will probably want to do a little configuration to suit your
    site, though.  There are one file you might want to edit:

	include/ldapconfig.h.edit
		This file contains #defines used by many parts of the
		distribution.  You'll at least want to change DEFAULT_BASE.

    See the INSTALL file in this directory for more information.
